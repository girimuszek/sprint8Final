Final Project Proposal (In case the link doesn't work)

    Product Name: TheBoys Story
    
    Team Members: Kacpoer Zalewski
    
    Application Overview Python interactive story game where users can pick up items they find and access locations depending on where they look by typing in 
    different "Actions" that they type in. 
    
    Technology Overview: "Import Time", Python language, complete lack of global variables (which made things a bit harder), lots of functions, 700 lines of code, can be executed in terminal or powershell 
  
    Proposal Last Updated (the date the proposal was last updated): 12-12-2022
    
    Feature List (prioritized list of features that can likely be delivered in the time allowed): Interactive story with numerous endings, ability to pick up and itilize items
    
    Future Feature List (non-prioritized list of end user features that would be implemented if there was more time)- Animations that would pop up in a separate window to help visualize the scene
    
    Basic Technical Features (list of technical features being implemented that demonstrates things you have learned in the class): Loads of functions, loops, use of terminal, adding items which can be stored and used later (variables)
    
    Advanced Technical Features (list of technical features being implemented that go beyond what we learned in class): Lack of global functions, "import time", which adds chronology to Python code.
   
Requirement 2

Implement at least four (4) meaningful features that are of similar complexity to features we delivered in previous applications.

Functions, saving variables for later use, python, loops


Requirement 3

Enhance your application so that it implements at least two (2) meaningful features that are greater in complexity than features we delivered in previous applications.

Lack of Global Variables (Which is harder to do, but works better in the long run)

Import Time Function


ORIGINALLY PLAN: 

A TheBoys Story will be an interactive story game that can be played in a browser. They can choose what can happen in the story by entering a series of numbers, answering yes or no questions, etc. They can pick up items that might help in their story. 

This application will be composed using Javascript. It will very significantly make use of functions, plus a lot of other very useful Javascript tools. 
   

   A story with multiple endings
   A lot of dialogue for the story
   Accessible through browse
   Items to collect which might help help with the story or certain actions


   A proper UI
   Images or miniature animations made using GMOD to accompany the game's story
   More story options


CURRENT PLAN:

A TheBoys Story will be an interactive python story game that can be played in a terminal session. They can choose what can happen in the story by picking up useful items and by picking prompts to advance the story. 

This application will be composed using Python. It will very significantly make use of functions, plus a lot of other very useful Python tools. 

This proposal was last updated on 12-12-2022

A story with multiple endings
A lot of dialogue for the story
Text that scrolls instead of being static by using "import time"
Items to collect which might help help with the story or certain actions, without using global variable


THINGS THAT I WOULD ADD IF I HAD THE TIME:

A proper UI
Images or miniature animations made using GMOD to accompany the game's story
More story options and lore
